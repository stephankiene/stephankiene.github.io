## Notes from the field
This site is a collection of my (anonymized) personal field notes from various customer projects, PoC, solution design experiments and hands-on technical trainings. 

It mainly serves the purpose to [support my own learning](https://aliabdaal.com/3popularrevisiontechniquesyoushouldavoid/), but is hopefully also helpful for people working on the same topics as I do. I'll avoid prose whenever possible and be as brief as I can be. 

Everything you see here ist built on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)] using the [Minmal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and runs on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
