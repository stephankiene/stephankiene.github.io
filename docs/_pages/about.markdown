## Notes from the field
This site is a collection of my (anonymized) field notes from customer projects, solution design experiments and hands-on technical trainings. 

It mainly serves the purpose to [support my own learning](https://aliabdaal.com/3popularrevisiontechniquesyoushouldavoid/), but is hopefully also helpful for people working on the same topics as I do. I'll avoid prose whenever possible and be as brief as I can be.
